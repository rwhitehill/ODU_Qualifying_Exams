\section*{A note on the solutions}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{A note on the solutions}

The following sections enumerate some problems from previous qualifying exams.
Please note that the solutions are only attempts.
There is no guarantee of their correctness, and it is up to the reader to critically examine them and decide on the degree of their validity.
Furthermore, there may be some typos in the work left unchecked.
If there are any obvious mistakes or typos, or if anything in the solutions is unclear, a message can be sent to the following email: \href{mailto:rwhit058@odu.edu}{rwhit058@odu.edu}.

The major sections are divided by the date of the exam, from most to least recent, and the subsections divide the subject type.
Note that the problem labels are maintained to correspond with their labels on the exam pdf from which they are copied.
