With the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L} = T - V$, the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion are given by
\begin{align*}
    \dv{t} \Big( \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{\dot{q}_i} \Big) - \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{q_i} = 0
.\end{align*}
We can modify these equations by introducing a function $\mathcal{F}(\dot{q}_i)$ that depends on the velocities only, writing expanded equations as follows:
\begin{align*}
    \dv{t} \Big( \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{\dot{q}_i} \Big) - \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{q_i} + \pdv{\mathcal{F}}{\dot{q}_i} = 0
\end{align*}
Let the Lagrangian for a system with one degree of freedom, $x$, be given by
\begin{align*}
    \mathcal{L} = \frac{m}{2} \dot{x}^2 - \frac{k}{2} x^2
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
    \mathcal{F} = \eta \dot{x}^2
,\end{align*}
where $\eta > 0$.

\begin{parts}
    \item Write down the expanded equation of motion defined above.

    \item What system is described by this equation of motion?

    \item Find an ansatz for the general solution (you may write $x(t)$ as a potentially complex-valued function which simplifies the math).

    \item Show that your ansatz solves the expanded equation of motion.

    \item Discuss the three difference cases for the solution, depending on $k$, $m$, and $\eta$.

A mathematical pendulum of length $l$ and mass $m$ is in a gravitational field with normal acceleration $g$ along the $-y$ axis.
The suspension point $O$ of the pendulum is driven by a motor along $x$ in such a way that the suspension point oscillates as shown in the Figure.

\begin{parts}
    \item Write down the Lagrangian of the system in terms of time-dependent coordinate of the suspension point $x(t)$ and the angle $\varphi(t)$.

    \item Write down a dynamic equation for $\varphi(t)$ and solve it for small-amplitude oscillations of $\varphi(t) \ll 1$ caused by the oscillating suspension point with $x(t) = x_0 \sin{\omega t}$ and $x_0 \ll l$.

The Lagrangian $L(\vb*{r}_i,\dot{\vb*{r}}_i)$ is invariant under rotations about an axis whose direction is specified by the unit vector $\vu*{n}$.
Here $\vb*{r}_i$ and $\dot{\vb*{r}}_i$ are the positions and velocities of particles $i = 1,\cdots,N$.
Knowing that under an infinitesimal rotation by an angle $\eta$ about $\vu*{n}$ a generic vector $\vb*{v}$ changes as

In a particle accelerator the momentum compaction factor $\alpha$ is a dimensionless number equal to the ratio of the relative change of the path length and the relative change of the momentum
\begin{align*}
    \alpha = \frac{\delta L}{L} \Big/ \frac{\delta p}{p} = \frac{p}{L} \dv{L}{p}
\end{align*}
Consider a satellite in a circular orbit.
What is the momentum compaction factor?

You may assume that the change of momentum is small and slow enough that the orbit is always circular.

\sol{

For circular paths, the path length is just the circumference of a circle with radius $R$: $L = 2 \pi R$.
Additionally, since the path is circular, the centrifugal and gravitational forces are always in equilibrium, allowing us to write
\begin{align}
    \frac{G M m}{R^2} = \frac{m v^2}{R} = \frac{p^2}{m R} \Rightarrow L = \frac{2 \pi G M m^2}{p^2}
.\end{align}
Thus
\begin{align}
    \eqbox{ \alpha = -\frac{p}{L} \frac{4 \pi G M m^2}{p^3} = -2 }

In a simple Atwood machine, two masses are suspended, under constant gravity, from the ends of a flexible, massless, inextensible rope that passes over an inertialessly rotating pulley.

Consider the region between two concentric spherical surfaces of radii $a$ and $b$.
On the inner boundary ($r = a$) of this region, the potential is constant,
\begin{align*}
    \phi(a,\theta) = 2 V_0
.\end{align*}

\begin{parts}
    \item Find the potential in the region $a \leq r \leq b$.

    \item Now suppose that the region between two concentric spherical surfaces is filled with the inhomogeneous charge density $\rho(\vb*{r}) = \lambda / r$, where $\lambda$ is a constant and $r$ is the distance to the center of the spheres.
    The potentials on the spherical surfaces are kept the same as in part (a).

    Find the solution of the Poisson equation in the region $a \leq r \leq b$.

    (Note: The inner and outer surfaces have surface charges that can create non-spherically symmetric potentials.)

(a) The relevant equation for this problem is Laplace's equation.
Since our geometry is spherical with azimuthal symmetry, we can immediately write
\begin{align}
    \Phi(\vec{r}) = \sum_{l} P_{l}(\cos{\theta}) \begin{cases}
        A_l r^l & r < a \\
        B_l r^l + C_l/r^{l+1} & a < r < b \\
        D_l / r^{l+1} & r > b
    \end{cases}
.\end{align}
We have two boundary conditions are each interface:
\begin{align}
    &(i) ~ \Phi(a) = 2 V_0 \\
    &(ii) ~ \Phi(a^{-}) = \Phi(a^{+}) \\
    &(iii) ~ \Phi(b) = V_0 \cos{\theta} \\
    &(iv) ~ \Phi(b^{-}) = \Phi(b^{+})
.\end{align}
The first gives us that
\begin{gather}
    \sum_l A_l a^l P_l(\cos{\theta}) = 2 V_0 \nonumber \\
    \sum_l A_l a^{l} \underbrace{ \int_{-1}^{1} \dd{(\cos{\theta})} P_{l}(\cos{\theta}) P_m(\cos{\theta}) }_{2/(2m + 1) \delta_{lm}} = 2 V_0 \int_{-1}^{1} \dd{(\cos{\theta})} P_0(\cos{\theta}) P_{m}(\cos{\theta}) \nonumber \\
    \frac{2}{2 m + 1} A_m a^m = 4 V_0 \delta_{m 0} \Rightarrow A_l = 2 V_0 \delta_{l 0}
.\end{gather}
The third condition by a similar argument and using that $P_1(\cos{\theta}) = \cos{\theta}$ yields $D_l = V_0 b^2 \delta_{l 1}$.
Next, we apply our continuity conditions:
\begin{align}
    A_l a^{2 l + 1} = B_l a^{2 l + 1} + C_l \\
    B_l b^{2 l + 1} + C_l = D_l
,\end{align}
which give
\begin{align}
    B_l &= \frac{D_l - A_l a^{2l + 1}}{b^{2l+1} - a^{2 l + 1}} = V_0 \Bigg[ \frac{b^2}{b^{3} - a^{3}} \delta_{l1} - \frac{2 a}{b - a} \delta_{l 0} \Bigg] \\
    C_l &= - \frac{a^{2l + 1}}{b^{2 l + 1} - a^{2 l + 1}} D_l + \frac{a^{2l+1}b^{2l+1}}{b^{2l+1} - a^{2l+1}} A_l = V_0 \Bigg[ \frac{2 a b}{b - a} \delta_{l 0} - \frac{a^3 b^2}{b^3 - a^3} \delta_{l1} \Bigg]
.\end{align}
Thus,
\begin{align}
\eqbox{
    \Phi(r,\theta) = V_0 \begin{cases}
        2 & r < a \\
        \frac{2}{b/a - 1} \Big( \frac{b}{r} - 1 \Big) + \Big( \frac{1}{1 - (a/b)^3} \frac{r}{b} - \frac{1}{(b/a)^3 - 1} \frac{b^2}{r^2} \Big) \cos{\theta} & a < r < b \\
        \frac{b^2}{r^2} \cos{\theta} & r > b
    \end{cases}
}
\end{align}


(b) We can do as requested by superimposing the solution from above with that of two grounded conductors with the specified volume charge density between the spheres.
Since the additional problem is spherically symmetric, we can use Gauss' law:
\begin{align}
    \oint \vb*{E} \cdot \dd{\vb*{A}} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0} \Rightarrow E(r) = \frac{Q_{a} + Q(r)}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{r^2}
,\end{align}
where $Q(r)$ is the charge enclosed by our Gaussian surface, which we choose to be a sphere of radius $r$, and $Q_{a}$ is the charge on the inner sphere.
We can compute the charge
\begin{align}
    Q(r) = 4 \pi \lambda \int_{a}^{r} r \dd{r} = 2 \pi \lambda ( r^2 - a^2 )
.\end{align}
The electric field is then
\begin{align}
    \vb*{E} = \frac{Q_a + 2 \pi \lambda (r^2 - a^2)}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2}
,\end{align}
and the potential is just
\begin{align}
    \Phi(r) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{r}^{b} \frac{Q_{a} + 2 \pi \lambda (r^2 - a^2)}{r^2} \dd{r} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \Bigg[ (Q_{a} - 2 \pi \lambda a^2) \Big( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{b} \Big) + 2 \pi \lambda ( b - r ) \Bigg]
.\end{align}
The form of the potential above gurantees that the outer sphere is grounded.
We now solve for $Q_{a}$ such that the inner sphere is also grounded as needed:
\begin{align}
    (Q_{a} - 2 \pi \lambda a^2) \Big( \frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{b} \Big) + 2 \pi \lambda ( b - a ) = 0 \Rightarrow Q_{a} = -2 \pi \lambda a ( b - a )
.\end{align}
Plugging this in, we find
\begin{align}
    \Phi(r) = 2 \pi \lambda \Bigg[ (b - r) - a \Big( \frac{b}{r} - 1 \Big) \Bigg]
\end{align}
as the potential between the spheres, and using the same line integration, we see that the potential is zero for this setup when $r < a$ and $r > b$.

Now that we have our results, the composite potential with the charge density between the spheres and the potential $2 V_0$ and $V_0 \cos{\theta}$ on the inner and outer spheres is
\begin{align}
    \eqbox{ \Phi(r,\theta) = \begin{cases}
        2 V_0 & r < a \\
        \frac{2 V_0}{b/a - 1} \Big( \frac{b}{r} - 1 \Big) + V_0 \Big( \frac{1}{1 - (a/b)^3} \frac{r}{b} - \frac{1}{(b/a)^3 - 1} \frac{b^2}{r^2} \Big) \cos{\theta} + 2 \pi \lambda \Big[ (b - r) - a \Big( \frac{b}{r} - 1 \Big) \Big] & a < r < b \\
        \frac{V_0 b^2}{r^2} \cos{\theta} & r > b
    \end{cases}
}
.\end{align}

Until 2019, the definition of the Ampere was as follows:
\textit{The ampere is that constant
current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length,
of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 meter apart in vacuum, would
produce between these conductors a force equal to $2 \times 10^{-7}$ newton per meter of
length.}

Obviously, this was a very impractical definition (``infinitely long, zero cross section wires'').
However, one \textit{can} approximate the implied measurement in the following way:
Consider a quadratic loop of wire, with a side length of $1~{\rm m}$ distance (and, yes, the wires are nearly infinitely thin yet totally rigid).

If we run a current $I$ of $1~{\rm Ampere}$ through both the square and the infinite wire, what will be the force that each conductor exerts on the other?
You may use symmetry arguments as much as possible to simplify the calculation, keeping in mind that we are only interested in the \textbf{net} force.
